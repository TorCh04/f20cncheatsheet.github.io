        <h3>2.8 CAESAR CIPHER</h3>
        <p>Caesar cipher (also known as a shift cipher) is a simple substitution cipher</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It essentially "shifts" every letter in the plain text m by e elements in the alphabet to the right</li>
            <li>So using e=3 as a key, the letter A is encrypted as D</li>
            <li>How to decrypt?

            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Alternative to the key mapping/table, we can use the following functions to describe the en/decryption</p>
        <p>E<sub>e</sub>(x) = x + 2 mod 26</p>
        <p>D<sub>e</sub>(x) = x - e mod 26</p>

                    <li>In the graph, H in the ciphertext (lighter line) resembles the frequency of E in the typical plaintext (darker line) - in fact, the lighter line looks to be shift 3 to the right, suggesting that the key is e=3</li>

        <h3>2.10 POLYALPOHABETIC SUBSTITUTION ATTACK</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Let's first assume that we know the key length, say 4</li>
            <li>To cryptanalyse, note that every 4th letter is shifted the same amount (since the key is of length 4)
                <ul>
                    <li>At a distance of repeated characters of 4, only 4 can be the key length, not multiples</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Thus, one can determine the distribution of the ciphertext letters in each of the four groups to determine the four shift amounts</li>

<h3>2.14 DESIGNING BLOCK CIPHERS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the fundamental principle behind block cipher design
                <ul>
                    <li>Block ciphers need to create non-linear mappings between plaintext and ciphertext blocks to prevent easy cryptanalysis. Good ciphers rely on a combination of confusion and diffusion properties.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What are the two key principles in block cipher design?
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Confusion</strong> (obscuring the relationship between key and ciphertext) and</li> 
                    <li><strong>Diffusion</strong> (spreading plaintext bits across the ciphertext to eliminate patterns)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>How many possible mappings exist for an n-bit block cipher?
                <ul>
                    <li>There are \((2^n)!\) possible mappings of plaintext blocks to ciphertext block</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Why are linear mappings considered weak for an encryption?
                <ul>
                    <li>A linear mappings (like \(c=am\) where \(a\) is the key) are vulnerable to known plaintext attacks. With just one plaintext-ciphertext pair, an attacker can easily compute the key</li>

                    <li>A 64-bit block cipher with a 56-bit key (+8 parity bits)</li>
                    <li>Encryption is performed over 16 rounds, with permutations (transpositions) at the start and end. Each round splits output from the previous into two halves (L and R) and performed the following:</li>

<h3>2.18 Hash Functions and Data Integrity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: What is a hash function?
                <ul>
                    <li>A function mapping inputs of arbitrary length to a fixed-size output (the hash/digest). Many simple constructions exist, but most are not secure.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: What is a cryptographic hash function?
                <ul>
                    <li>A hash function designed to satisfy specific hardness properties (below). We typically denote it h, with output h(x).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Core properties</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: What does one-way (<strong>preimage resistance</strong>) mean?
                <ul>
                    <li>Given \(y = h(x)\), it's computationally hard to find any x such that \(h(x) = y\).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: What is weak <strong>collision resistance</strong> (second preimage resistance)?
                <ul>
                    <li>Given a specific \(x\) (and \(h(x)\)), it's hard to find \(x' \neq x\) with \(h(x') = h(x)\)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: What is (<strong>strong</strong>) collision resistance?
                <ul>
                    <li>It's hard to find any pair \(x \neq y\) such that \(h(x) = h(y)\)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: Which functions are current examples?
                <ul>
                    <li>MD5 and SHA-1 are broken for collisions; use SHA-256/384/512 or SHA3-256/512.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Where hash functions are used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: Password storage — how are hashes used?
                <ul>
                    <li>Store \(H = PHF(password, salt)\) where PHF is a slow password-hashing function (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2). On login, compute and compare. One-wayness helps protect leaked databases; slowness thwarts guessing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: Key derivation from passphrases — which functions?
                <ul>
                    <li>Use KDFs like PBKDF2-HMAC, scrypt, Argon2 to derive keys from passphrases. They add iteration/memory-hardness to resist brute force.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: Proof of Work — what property is used?
                <ul>
                    <li>One-wayness: find nonce so that h(header || nonce) has required form (e.g., leading zeros). Hard to find; easy to verify.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: Data integrity — which property is relevant?
                <ul>
                    <li>Weak collision resistance: an attacker shouldn't be able to replace x by x' with the same digest.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: Digital signatures — what property is critical?
                <ul>
                    <li>Collision resistance: signing h(m) should not allow an attacker to find a different m' with the same hash (non-repudiation requires avoiding collisions).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>From confidentiality to integrity</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: Do ciphers like AES-CBC/CTR or ChaCha20 provide integrity?
                <ul>
                    <li>No. They provide confidentiality only. Attackers can modify ciphertext; without integrity checks, changes may go undetected (and can be controlled in stream/CTR modes).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Integrity with an unkeyed hash</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: How can a plain hash help with integrity?
                <ol>
                    <li>Alice sends x over an insecure channel.</li>
                    <li>Alice sends h(x) over an authentic channel (e.g., phone or a well-known, authenticated page).</li>
                    <li>Bob computes h(x') on what he received; accept iff h(x') = h(x).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Explanation: By weak collision resistance, finding \(x' \neq x\) with equal hash should be infeasible. The separate authentic channel is essential; otherwise an attacker could swap both x and \(h(x)\).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and HMAC</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: What is a MAC?
                <ul>
                    <li>A keyed integrity check: given shared secret K, compute \(tag = MAC_K(x)\). Only holders of K can produce valid tags. Verifier recomputes \(MAC_K(x')\) and checks equality.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: What is HMAC?
                <ul>
                    <li>A MAC built from a cryptographic hash. Notation: \(h_K(x) = HMAC(K, x)\). Standard choices: HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-512.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: How does HMAC work (equation)?
                <ul>
                    <li>\[HMAC(K, m) = H((K' \oplus opad) \| H((K' \oplus ipad) \| m))\], where:
                        <ul>
                            <li>H is a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256),</li>
                            <li>K' is K adjusted to the hash block size (padded or hashed),</li>
                            <li>ipad/opad are fixed constants,</li>
                            <li>|| is concatenation, \(\oplus\) is XOR.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Explanation: The inner and outer hash with different paddings prevent extension attacks and tie the tag to K and m.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: How is HMAC used for integrity?
                <ul>
                    <li>Send (x, t) where t = HMAC(K, x).</li>
                    <li>Receiver recomputes t' = HMAC(K, x') and accepts iff t' = t.</li>
                    <li>No separate authentic channel is needed; the key provides authenticity.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Why each property matters (quick checks)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: Why isn't one-wayness alone enough for integrity?
                <ul>
                    <li>An attacker who can choose x and x' might aim for h(x) = h(x') without needing to invert h; collision resistance protects against that.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: Why do passwords need "slow" hashing?
                <ul>
                    <li>Fast hashes let attackers test billions of guesses per second. Slow/MEM-hard functions reduce guessing rate, improving security.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: Why are MD5/SHA-1 unsafe for signatures?
                <ul>
                    <li>Their collision resistance is broken; an attacker can craft two different documents with the same hash and reuse a signature.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Equations and verification logic</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: Integrity with hash over two channels — what equality is checked?
                <ul>
                    <li>Accept iff \(h(x') = h(x_{authentic})\). If an attacker changes x → x', they must also forge the authentic h(x), which they cannot if the authentic channel is trusted.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: Integrity with HMAC — what equality is checked?
                <ul>
                    <li>Accept iff \(HMAC(K, x') = t\). Without K, forging t is infeasible (reduces to breaking the PRF-like security of HMAC).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Practical tips and pitfalls</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: Common mistakes to avoid?
                <ul>
                    <li>Using plain fast hash for passwords (use bcrypt/scrypt/Argon2 instead).</li>
                    <li>Relying on a plain hash for integrity without an authentic channel (use HMAC or an AEAD).</li>
                    <li>Using MD5/SHA-1 for signatures or long-term integrity.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Q: How to remember the three properties quickly?
                <ul>
                    <li>"P-SC": Preimage (hard to find \(x\) from \(h(x)\)), Second-preimage (hard to find \(x'\) for given \(x\)), Collision (hard to find any pair colliding).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Q: Hash vs MAC in one line?
                <ul>
                    <li>Hash = integrity only if authenticated out-of-band; MAC = integrity + authenticity with a shared key.</li>
                </ul>

<h3>2.23 $M$ IS NOT RELATIVELY PRIME TO $n$</h3>
        <p>We want to show that <strong>RSA decryption still gives the correct message</strong>, even when</p>

        <p>\[\gcd(M, n) \neq 1\]</p>
        <p>That is, even if \(M\) shares a factor with \(n = pq\)</p>

        <p>Normally, we rely on <strong>Euler's Theorem</strong>, which only works if \(M\) and \(n\) are <em>coprime</em>.<br>  
        So when they aren't, we need another argument.</p>

            <li>\(M\) is a multiple of \(p\) (so \(\gcd(M,n) = p\)), or</li>

            <li>\(M\) is a multiple of both \(p\) and \(q\) (so \(\gcd(M,n) = n = pq\))</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Let's prove case 1 (the others are similar):</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start with the case where \(M\) is a multiple of \(p\)</strong>
                <p>This means \(M = ip\) for some integer \(i\), where \(0 < i < q\)</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>We know that</strong>
                <p>\[ed = 1 + k\varphi(n) = 1 + k(p-1)(q-1)\]</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Consider \(M^{ed} \bmod n\)</strong>
                <p>\[M^{ed} = M \times M^{k(p-1)(q-1)}\]</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Since \(M = ip\), this becomes</strong>
                <p>\[(ip)^{ed} = ip \times (ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)}\]</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Note that</strong>
                <p>\[(ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)} = (ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)}\]</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Looking at this expression modulo \(p\):</strong>
                <p>\[(ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 0 \pmod p\]</p>
                <p>(because any power of \(ip\) is a multiple of \(p\))</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Now consider the expression modulo \(q\):</strong>
                <p>\[(ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)} = i^{k(p-1)(q-1)} \times p^{k(p-1)(q-1)}\]</p>
                <p>By Fermat's Little Theorem, since \(q\) is prime:</p>
                <p>\[i^{q-1} \equiv 1 \pmod q\]</p>
                <p>And since \((p-1)(q-1)\) is a multiple of \(q-1\):</p>
                <p>\[i^{k(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 1 \pmod q\]</p>
                <p>Also, \(p^{q-1} \equiv 1 \pmod q\) (as long as \(p\) is not a multiple of \(q\), which it isn't since \(p\) and \(q\) are distinct primes)</p>
                <p>Therefore:</p>
                <p>\[(ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv i^{k(p-1)(q-1)} \times p^{k(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 1 \times 1 \equiv 1 \pmod q\]</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can combine these results:</strong>
                <p>\[(ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 0 \pmod p\]</p>
                <p>\[(ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 1 \pmod q\]</p>
                <p>This means \((ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)} = hq\) for some integer \(h\)</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Therefore:</strong>
                <p>\[M^{ed} \bmod n = (ip \times (ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)}) \bmod n = (ip \times hq) \bmod n = (ihpq) \bmod n\]</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Since \(pq = n\), we have:</strong>
                <p>\[M^{ed} \bmod n = (ihn) \bmod n = 0 \bmod n\]</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>But this contradicts what we expected:</strong>
                <p>We should get \(M^{ed} \bmod n = M \bmod n = ip \bmod n\), not 0</p>
                <p>The error is that we incorrectly assumed \((ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)} = hq\). The correct formula is:</p>
                <p>\[(ip)^{k(p-1)(q-1)} = 1 + hq\]</p>
                <p>for some integer \(h\)</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>With this correction:</strong>
                <p>\[M^{ed} \bmod n = (ip \times (1 + hq)) \bmod n = (ip + ihpq) \bmod n = ip \bmod n\]</p>
                <p>(since \(ihpq = ihn\) is a multiple of \(n\))</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>And since \(ip = M\), we have:</strong>
                <p>\[M^{ed} \bmod n = M \bmod n = M\]</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Therefore, even if \(M\) is <em>not relatively prime to</em> \(n\), RSA decryption still recovers the original message.</p>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Where is modular exponentiation used in RSA, and why is efficiency important?</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>Used during encryption \(C = M^e \bmod n\) and decryption \(M = C^d \bmod n\)</li>
                    <li>Efficient algorithms (like square-and-multiply) are crucial because these operations are performed on large numbers and can be computationally expensive.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

<h3>2.26 RSA Remarks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Is textbook RSA deterministic or randomized? Why is this a problem?</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>Textbook RSA is deterministic: if \(M_1 = M_2\), then  \(C_1 = C_2\)</li>
                    <li>This predictability makes it vulnerable to chosen plaintext and other attacks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How is RSA made secure in practice?</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>In practice, RSA is used with randomization (e.g., padding schemes like OAEP or salting the plaintext).</li>
                    <li>Randomization prevents attacks that exploit its deterministic nature.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Why is the public exponent \( e \) typically chosen to be small?</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>A small \(e\) (like 65537) makes encryption faster than decryption.</li>
                    <li>Exponentiation with a small exponent requires fewer multiplications.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How can knowing \( p \) and \( q \) help with efficient decryption?</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>If the recipient retains \( p \) and \( q \), they can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to speed up decryption.</li>
                    <li>CRT makes modular exponentiation much more efficient.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>What is the typical use of RSA in real-world systems?</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>RSA is usually used to encrypt symmetric session keys, not entire messages.</li>
                    <li>This approach, called hybrid encryption, combines the efficiency of symmetric ciphers with the key distribution advantages of RSA.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How do RSA key sizes and computational costs compare to symmetric ciphers like AES?</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>RSA keys are much larger and computations are more expensive than symmetric ciphers like AES.</li>
                    <li>This is why RSA is used mainly for key exchange, not bulk data encryption</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

<h3>2.27 HYBRID ENCRYPTION</h3>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Why is hybrid encryption more efficient than using only asymmetric encryption?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Symmetric encryption is much faster than asymmetric encryption for large amounts of data, making the hybrid approach more efficient while maintaining security</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>What role does RSA play in hybrid encryption?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>RSA is used to asymmetrically encrypt and share the symmetric key between parties</li>

                    <li>ElGamal is based on the difficulty of the <strong>discrete logarithm problem</strong> in finite fields</li>
                    <li>Given \(g\) and \(g^x\) in a finite field, it's computationally hard to find \(x\)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How does ElGamal key generation work?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select a large prime \(p\) and a generator \(g\) of the multiplicative group \(\mathbb{Z}_p^*\)</li>
                    <li>Choose a random private key \(x\) where \(1 \leq x \leq p-2\)</li>
                    <li>Compute the public key \(y = g^x \bmod p\)</li>
                    <li>Public parameters: \((p, g, y)\), Private key: \(x\)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>How is a message encrypted with ElGamal?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>To encrypt message \(m\) (where \(m < p\)) with public key \((p, g, y)\):
                        <ol>
                            <li>Choose a random \(k\) where \(1 \leq k \leq p-2\)</li>
                            <li>Compute \(a = g^k \bmod p\) (first component of ciphertext)</li>
                            <li>Compute \(b = m \cdot y^k \bmod p\) (second component of ciphertext)</li>
                            <li>The ciphertext is the pair \((a, b)\)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>To decrypt ciphertext \((a, b)\) with private key \(x\):

                            <li>Compute \(s = a^x \bmod p\)</li>
                            <li>Compute \(m = b \cdot s^{-1} \bmod p\)</li>
                            <li>This works because \(s = a^x = (g^k)^x = g^{kx} = y^k\)</li>
                            <li>So \(m = b \cdot s^{-1} = m \cdot y^k \cdot (y^k)^{-1} = m\)</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Why is the ElGamal cryptosystem secure?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The security of ElGamal depends on two key factors:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Practical security:</strong> Choosing a new random number \(k\) for every encryption (if \(k\) is reused, the system becomes vulnerable)</li>
                            <li><strong>Fundamental security:</strong> The difficulty of solving the <strong>discrete logarithm problem</strong> (given \(g^x \bmod p\), it's computationally infeasible to find \(x\))</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>The discrete logarithm problem is believed to be computationally hard, similar to the integer factorisation problem that secures RSA</li>

            </li>
            <li><strong>What mathematical principles prove that ElGamal decryption works?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The correctness of ElGamal is proven by showing that \[D_x(E_{(p,g,y)}(m)) = m\]
                        <ul>
                            <li>Starting with \(b(a^{x})^{-1} \bmod p\)</li>
                            <li>Substituting definitions: \(my^k((g^k)^x)^{-1} \bmod p\)</li>
                            <li>Applying \(y = g^x: m(g^x)^k(g^{kx})^{-1} \bmod p\)</li>
                            <li>Simplifying: \(mg^{kx} \cdot g^{-kx} \bmod p\)</li>
                            <li>Which equals \(m \bmod p=m\)</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is integer factorization in cryptography?</strong>  
                <ul>
                    <li>Integer factorization is the mathematical problem of finding the prime factorization of a positive integer n.</li>
                    <li>It involves finding distinct primes \(p_i\) such that \(n = p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_n^{e_n}\) for some \(e_i \geq 1\).</li>

<h3>2.29 Security of Asymmetric Ciphers</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What is integer factorization in cryptography?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Integer factorization is the mathematical problem of finding the prime factorization of a positive integer n.</li>
      <li>It involves finding distinct primes p<sub>i</sub> such that n = p<sub>1</sub><sup>e<sub>1</sub></sup> ⋯ p<sub>n</sub><sup>e<sub>n</sub></sup> for some e<sub>i</sub> ≥ 1.</li>
      <li>This problem forms the security basis for the RSA cryptosystem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is the RSA Problem (RSAP) and why is it important?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>RSAP is the problem of finding m such that m<sup>e</sup> = c mod n when given n (where n = pq, p and q are primes), e (where gcd(e,(p-1)(q-1)) = 1), and c.</li>
      <li>This is essentially the problem of computing the eth root modulo n without knowing the factorization.</li>
      <li>It represents the core computational challenge that must be solved to break RSA encryption.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>DLP involves finding the integer x (where 0 ≤ x ≤ p-2) such that g<sup>x</sup> = a mod p, given prime p, generator g of ℤ<sub>p</sub>, and element a.</li>
      <li>It's the mathematical foundation for ElGamal encryption and many other cryptosystems.</li>
      <li>Computing discrete logarithms is believed to be computationally difficult, which provides security.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is the Diffie-Hellman Problem (DH)?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The DH problem is computing g<sup>xy</sup> mod p when given only p, generator g, g<sup>x</sup> mod p, and g<sup>y</sup> mod p.</li>
      <li>This problem underlies the security of Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</li>
      <li>If this problem could be efficiently solved, the shared secret in DH key exchange would be compromised.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is the relationship between these cryptographic problems?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>RSAP ≤<sub>P</sub> FACTORING: This means the RSA problem can be efficiently reduced to the factoring problem.</li>
      <li>DH ≤<sub>P</sub> DLP: The Diffie-Hellman problem can be efficiently reduced to the discrete logarithm problem.</li>
      <li>These reductions mean that if we can solve the harder problem (factoring or DLP), we can also solve the easier problem (RSAP or DH).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What does the notation "A ≤<sub>P</sub> B" mean in cryptographic complexity?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A ≤<sub>P</sub> B means there exists a polynomial-time (efficient) reduction from problem A to problem B.</li>
      <li>In practical terms, it means if you can solve problem B efficiently, you can also solve problem A efficiently.</li>
      <li>This helps establish hierarchies of problem difficulty in cryptography.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What security properties do RSA, ElGamal, and DH provide and what do they lack?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>These asymmetric cryptosystems can provide confidentiality (keeping messages secret).</li>
      <li>However, they do not inherently provide integrity or data-origin authentication.</li>
      <li>This means they cannot by themselves prove who sent a message or that it wasn't altered.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is a man-in-the-middle attack and how does it affect asymmetric cryptosystems?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communications between two parties.</li>
      <li>RSA, ElGamal, and DH are susceptible to this attack during key exchange if used without additional authentication.</li>
      <li>The attacker can establish separate connections with both parties and relay messages between them while seeing all communication.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is the fundamental authentication challenge in asymmetric cryptography?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The fundamental challenge is: "How can Alice confirm that it's Bob's public key that she has received?"</li>
      <li>Without solving this authentication problem, asymmetric cryptography is vulnerable to impersonation attacks.</li>
      <li>Public key infrastructure (PKI) and digital certificates were developed to address this challenge.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Why is the difficulty of these mathematical problems important for cryptographic security?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The security of asymmetric cryptosystems directly depends on the computational difficulty of these problems.</li>
      <li>If efficient algorithms were discovered for factoring or discrete logarithms, the corresponding cryptosystems would be broken.</li>
      <li>The absence of known efficient algorithms for these problems is what makes modern asymmetric cryptography secure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>2.30 Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Diffie-Hellman</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What is a Man-in-the-Middle attack against Diffie-Hellman?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A Man-in-the-Middle attack is when an attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Why is basic Diffie-Hellman vulnerable to MITM attacks?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Diffie-Hellman provides confidentiality but not authentication. Without additional authentication, there's no way to verify who you're actually establishing a shared key with.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How does an attacker execute a MITM attack against Diffie-Hellman?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The attacker positions themselves between Alice and Bob</li>
      <li>Instead of Alice and Bob establishing a shared key directly, the attacker establishes separate keys with each of them</li>
      <li>This allows the attacker to decrypt, read, and re-encrypt all messages passing between Alice and Bob</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What specific steps does the attacker take?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The attacker chooses their own secret value e in Zₚ (the set of integers modulo p)</li>
      <li>When Alice tries to perform a key exchange with Bob, the attacker intercepts and performs a key exchange with Alice using e</li>
      <li>Similarly, the attacker performs a separate key exchange with Bob using e</li>
      <li>As a result, the attacker shares one key with Alice and another key with Bob</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What can the attacker do after establishing these separate keys?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Decrypt messages from Alice using their shared key</li>
      <li>Read the message contents</li>
      <li>Re-encrypt the messages with the key shared with Bob before forwarding</li>
      <li>Neither Alice nor Bob knows their communication is being intercepted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How can Diffie-Hellman be protected from MITM attacks?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>By adding authentication to verify the identity of each party</li>
      <li>Using digital signatures to sign the exchanged values</li>
      <li>Implementing a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with certificates</li>
      <li>Using authenticated key exchange protocols like Station-to-Station (STS) protocol</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>2.31 Digital Signatures</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What is it?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document.</li>
      <li>It is created using the sender's private key and can be verified using the sender's public key.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How does Alice create a digital signature?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Alice uses her private key to digitally sign a message.</li>
      <li>In practice, rather than signing the entire message, Alice typically signs the hash of the message: s = s<sub>B</sub>(h(m)).</li>
      <li>Alice then sends both the message and the signature (m,s) to Bob.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is an example of a signature algorithm?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Common signature algorithms include RSA-PSS, DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), and EC-DSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).</li>
      <li>A textbook RSA signature is computed as s = h(m)<sup>d</sup> mod n, where d is Alice's private key and n is the RSA modulus.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How does Bob verify Alice's signature?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Bob uses Alice's public key to verify the signature.</li>
      <li>In the case of RSA, Bob computes s<sup>e</sup> mod n (where e is Alice's public exponent) and checks if it equals h(m).</li>
      <li>If they match, the signature is valid; if not, the message may have been tampered with or wasn't signed by Alice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is the advantage of digital signatures over symmetric authentication schemes like HMACs?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Digital signatures provide public verifiability - anyone with access to the signer's public key can verify the signature.</li>
      <li>In contrast, symmetric schemes like HMACs require the verifier to have the same secret key as the signer, limiting verification to parties who share that key.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What problem must be solved for digital signatures to be meaningful?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The authenticity of the public key itself must be established.</li>
      <li>If Bob can't be sure he has Alice's real public key (and not an attacker's), the signature verification is meaningless.</li>
      <li>This is known as the key authentication problem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How is the public key authentication problem solved?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Alice's public key must be contained in a digital certificate.</li>
      <li>This certificate is digitally signed by a trusted third party (Certificate Authority) that vouches for the authenticity of the key.</li>
      <li>This creates a chain of trust that helps recipients verify they have the correct public key.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What happens in a man-in-the-middle attack against digital signatures?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Without proper public key authentication, an attacker could substitute their own public key for Alice's.</li>
      <li>The attacker could then sign messages pretending to be Alice.</li>
      <li>Recipients would verify the signature as valid (using the attacker's public key) without realizing they're not communicating with Alice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What information is typically included in a digital certificate?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The subject's identity information (name, organization, etc.)</li>
      <li>The subject's public key</li>
      <li>The certificate's validity period</li>
      <li>The digital signature of the Certificate Authority</li>
      <li>Information about the Certificate Authority</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How do digital signatures differ from encryption?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Encryption provides confidentiality (keeping content secret)</li>
      <li>Digital signatures provide authentication (proving who created the message) and integrity (proving the message hasn't been altered)</li>
      <li>Encryption uses the recipient's public key, while signing uses the sender's private key</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>2.32 Certificate Authorities (CAs)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What is a Certificate Authority (CA)?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A Certificate Authority is a trusted third party that issues and manages digital certificates used to verify the identity of entities in a public key infrastructure (PKI).</li>
      <li>CAs act as trusted intermediaries that bind public keys to identities (people, organizations, or systems) by signing certificates.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How does the CA solve the public key authentication problem?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The CA solves the fundamental problem of "How do I know this public key belongs to who it claims to belong to?"</li>
      <li>Without CAs, users would have no reliable way to verify the authenticity of public keys they receive, making man-in-the-middle attacks easy to execute.</li>
      <li>The CA vouches for the authenticity of public keys by digitally signing them with its own private key.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is contained in a digital certificate issued by a CA?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The subject's identity information (name, organization, email, etc.)</li>
      <li>The subject's public key</li>
      <li>The certificate's validity period (issue and expiry dates)</li>
      <li>The digital signature of the CA</li>
      <li>Information about the CA that issued it</li>
      <li>The certificate's serial number</li>
      <li>The certificate's intended purpose</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How does Alice distribute her public key securely?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Alice distributes her public key together with the certificate she received from the CA.</li>
      <li>The certificate binds Alice's identity to her public key through the CA's digital signature.</li>
      <li>This prevents an attacker from substituting a different public key.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How can Bob verify that Alice's public key is authentic?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Bob uses the CA's public key (which he already trusts and possesses) to verify the CA's digital signature on Alice's certificate.</li>
      <li>If the signature verification succeeds, Bob can trust that Alice's public key is authentic.</li>
      <li>This works because only the legitimate CA could have created a valid signature using its private key.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is the chain of trust in PKI?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The chain of trust starts with Root CAs, whose certificates are self-signed and widely distributed.</li>
      <li>Root CAs issue certificates to Intermediate CAs.</li>
      <li>Intermediate CAs issue certificates to end entities (like Alice).</li>
      <li>Trust flows from the Root CA through the chain to the end entity.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What happens when a CA's private key is compromised?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>All certificates issued by that CA become untrustworthy.</li>
      <li>The CA must revoke all affected certificates.</li>
      <li>A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) can be used to check if certificates are still valid.</li>
      <li>This is why protecting CA private keys is critically important.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>How are CAs themselves verified?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Root CAs are typically verified through "out-of-band" methods.</li>
      <li>Their certificates come pre-installed in operating systems and browsers.</li>
      <li>The developers of these systems carefully vet which Root CAs to include.</li>
      <li>This creates a "web of trust" where certain CAs are inherently trusted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What is the difference between a self-signed certificate and a CA-signed certificate?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A self-signed certificate is signed by the same entity that it identifies (the subject signs their own certificate).</li>
      <li>A CA-signed certificate is signed by a trusted third party (the CA).</li>
      <li>Self-signed certificates don't provide third-party verification of identity, while CA-signed certificates do.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>What role do CAs play in securing internet communications?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>CAs enable secure HTTPS connections by certifying the authenticity of website certificates.</li>
      <li>They help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by providing a trusted way to verify the identity of the server you're connecting to.</li>
      <li>Without CAs, secure e-commerce and private communication over the internet would be much more difficult.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
