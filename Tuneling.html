    <h2>Tunneling</h2>
    <div class="note">
        <strong>Definition:</strong> Tunneling is the process of sending private data through a public network in a way that hides it from unauthorized access.

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q: What is tunneling?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The process of sending private data through a public network where it could normally be visible to prying eyes.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q: How does a private tunnel protect data on a public network?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>It “bores through” the public network to hide the contents of the data.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q: What happens to the data before it is sent through the tunnel?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The data is first <strong>encrypted</strong> and then <strong>encapsulated</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q: What is encapsulation in the context of tunneling?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Encapsulation is the process of enclosing the encrypted data with an additional header so that the data can be directed to its destination.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q: What would happen if all data, including its header, was completely encrypted during transmission?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Network routers would not be able to forward the packet to its destination.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q: How is encrypted information able to travel across networks as normal?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>By encapsulating the encrypted information with unencrypted information, allowing routers to read the necessary forwarding details.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q: What is the technique called that allows secure transport of data across a network in this way?</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tunneling</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Key Points for Exam</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tunneling = Securely sending private data over public networks</li>
        <li>Data is <strong>encrypted</strong> (for privacy) and <strong>encapsulated</strong> (for routing)</li>
        <li>Encapsulation adds a readable header so routers can forward the packet</li>
        <li>If headers were encrypted, routing would fail</li>
        <li>Tunneling is essential for VPNs and secure communications</li>
    </ul>
